### Combining Design and Development in Digital Production

As part of the Interdisciplinary Digital Studio Capstone, my thesis aimed to prove the benefits of combining Design & Development in Digital Produciton. 

I researched the trends in the current production process, interviewed a range of creative technologists, and reports my findings and these to a group of colleagues. 

This website and design document present the findings.
